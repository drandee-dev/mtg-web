"""Shared loader for Scryfall bulk data with a pickled sidecar cache.

Parsing the ~500MB ``default-cards.json`` from disk takes 3-8 seconds and
dominates the wall-clock cost of every script that touches Scryfall data.
A pickle of the same parsed list loads roughly 5-10x faster, so a single
sidecar file shared across all callers eliminates most of that cost for
the second and subsequent calls in a session.

The sidecar lives at ``<bulk_path>.idx.pkl`` and is invalidated when the
underlying JSON is newer or when the on-disk format version doesn't match.
Concurrent rebuilds are safe: writes go through a temp file plus an atomic
rename so a partially-written sidecar can never be observed.

Callers build a name->record index on top of the returned list through the
shared ``mtg_utils._name_index`` core (``build_name_index`` / ``alias_keys``):
the keying — NFKD folding, every-face DFC handling, Arena aliases — is one
implementation, while the genuinely per-caller policy (cheapest-printing vs
lowest-rarity vs first-seen, the stored value shape, the prefilter) stays as
knobs there.
