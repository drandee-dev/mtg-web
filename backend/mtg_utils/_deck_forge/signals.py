"""Deterministic signal extraction — the discovery-engine keystone.

A ``Signal`` is a precisely-scoped fact pulled from a card's oracle text: what it
cares about / triggers on, *whose* resource it concerns (scope), and — when the
clause names one — the *subject* it cares about (a creature subtype). Scope and
subject are part of the signal's identity, which is how we avoid overgeneralization:
a card that benefits from an opponent's graveyard yields ``graveyard_matters`` scoped
``opponents`` (never a generic one that would justify self-mill), and a Goblin lord
yields ``type_matters`` with ``subject="Goblin"`` (never collapsed into a generic
"creatures matter").

Three tiers, all keyless and precision-gated:

  1. **Baseline detectors** — the original substring/regex bag (creature_etb,
     graveyard_matters, …). Subject-free.
  2. **Parametric subject detectors** — ``type_matters`` / ``token_maker`` /
     ``typed_spellcast`` capture the subtype noun, singularize it, and validate it
     against the harvested creature-subtype vocabulary (``_subtypes``). An
     unresolvable capture emits nothing (silent drop = the safe failure mode), so
     clones / "Plant creature" / card-type words never become junk subjects.
  3. **Structural-anchor floor detectors + theme_presets reuse** — whole archetypes
     the baseline was blind to (treasure / artifacts / enchantments / tokens / stax),
     each requiring a ``X you control`` / ``for each X`` / ``whenever … enters`` /
     ``opponents can't`` anchor; plus a curated subset of ``theme_presets`` (blink /
     mill / goad / proliferate / magecraft / extra-combats / extra-turns).

One narrow structural scope rule (combat-damage-to-a-player + "that player's <zone>"
→ opponents) deterministically fixes the Tinybones bug without the broad
possessive→opponents rule that would misfire on self-blink/self-bounce cards.

``coverage_gate`` reports the extractor's own blind spots (zero-signal / only-generic
/ scope-uncertain) so the session-agent (M3, ADR-0009) can scope the residual tail
with mandatory oracle-clause quotes — blind spots are queued, never silently dropped.
