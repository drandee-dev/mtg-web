"""Swept detector set — mined exhaustively from real Scryfall oracle text.

Each entry is one ability-axis detector: a structural-anchor regex (validated
against bulk, never authored from memory — ADR-0009), a scope, and is_widen_of
(the existing key it extends, or "" for a brand-new axis). The extractor compiles
these into Detector records (_FLOOR_DETECTORS) and signal_specs auto-registers an
avenue per key.
Regenerate via the exhaustive-residual-sweep workflow. Two clause-scoped baseline
widens (creature_etb, death_matters) are intentionally excluded here — their
originals keep clause scope.
