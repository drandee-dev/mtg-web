"""Slot budgets vs the (soft) Command Zone deckbuilding template.

Role targets are *nudges* (D8): the hard land/curve gate lives in ``mana_audit``. Each
role budget reports min/max band, current, remaining (to the floor), and deviation
(distance outside the band) so the build loop can size a "choose up to N" batch and the
Tune surface can rank template gaps.

The template is **bands** (Command Zone Ep. 658, verified multi-source), not single
points, and ``slot_budgets`` takes an optional ``shape``: ``None`` (the always-on
Budgets panel) uses flat bands; a Shape (the Tune surface, near-complete deck) scales
them.
Counterspells fold into a single ``interaction`` role; win-cons and protection are NOT
counted roles here — they are Tier-2 advisory flags (ADR-0024).
