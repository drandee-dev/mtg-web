"""The deck-forge engine: deck analysis over a ``ForgeState``, behind its own seam.

These were private functions inside ``app.py``, reachable only through the HTTP routes
(``TestClient(build_app(state)).get("/api/snapshot")``). Pulled out as free functions
over ``ForgeState``, they become the direct test surface — the interface IS the test
surface — and let ``app.py`` shrink to a transport adapter.

Free functions, deliberately NOT a ``DeckEngine`` class: ``ForgeState.session`` is
mutable and every mutation route edits it in place, so a class that cached a
``HydratedDeck`` at construction would desync on the next add/remove. A free function
reads ``state`` at call time and can never go stale.
