"""Wire serialization for the deck-forge browser surface — the card-view shapes the
Svelte SPA consumes.

Split out of ``app.py`` (and the deck-analysis ``engine``) so the frontend contract
lives in ONE module the SPA can be diffed against. Every card the UI renders is one of
four named shapes, and all four compose the single atomic projection ``project`` — so a
new display field is one edit here, not five scattered across the route bodies (where
the deck / search / candidate / combo serializers had already drifted).
