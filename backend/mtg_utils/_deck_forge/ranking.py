"""Transparent multi-axis candidate ranking (D6).

Every candidate exposes separate readouts — synergy fit (which signals/avenues it
serves), mana efficiency (cmc), and price — rather than one opaque score. EDHREC
popularity is deliberately absent. Default order is synergy fit then price (cheapest
first), with no-listing cards sorted last on the price axis (never treated as free).

Synergy fit counts both the deck's scoped signals AND the active avenues (each
avenue's search-oracle is a matcher), so a card that feeds several lanes outscores
one that feeds a single broad signal — which is what makes the ranking discriminate.
