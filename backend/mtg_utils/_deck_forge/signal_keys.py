"""Canonical signal-key constants shared by the detector and the exploitation map.

A signal ``key`` is a contract between ``signals.py`` (which emits ``Signal(key=...)``)
and ``signal_specs.py`` (which maps ``(key, scope)`` to an avenue spec). It used to live
as a bare magic string in both, so a typo on either side was a *silent* no-avenue. These
constants give the cross-file keys a compile-time handle — a typo dies as an
``AttributeError`` at import instead of vanishing — and the key-agreement gate at the
bottom of ``signal_specs.py`` asserts every detector-produced key resolves to a spec.

Each constant's VALUE is exactly the on-the-wire key (``Signal.key`` / ``SPECS`` tuple
key / the SPA's JSON), so this is runtime-identical to the strings it replaces. Leaf
module — stdlib only, no deck-forge imports — so both files import it cycle-free.
