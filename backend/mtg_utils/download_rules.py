"""Comprehensive Rules downloader.

Mirrors the ``download-bulk`` pattern: fetches the official Wizards of
the Coast MTG Comprehensive Rules TXT to the output directory, with a
24-hour freshness check that reuses an existing local copy instead of
re-downloading. Writes are atomic-rename so a crashed download cannot
leave a half-written file for ``rules-lookup`` to trip over.

Because the release cadence of the CR is irregular (a new version drops
alongside each set release or errata pass), we first GET the rules
landing page to discover the latest ``MagicCompRules 2026MMDD.txt``
download link, then fetch that. A locally-cached filename pattern
``comprehensive-rules-YYYYMMDD.txt`` lets ``rules-lookup`` find the
newest file without flags.
