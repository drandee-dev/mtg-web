"""Canonical card-name normalization for cross-source lookup.

A single implementation shared by every tuner script that needs to ask
"does this name from source A refer to the same card as this name from
source B?" Having one function rather than per-script copies matters
because the comparison is load-bearing for correctness: if two callers
drift on Unicode folding rules, a card can be "owned" by one script
and "unknown" to another, and the resulting bug is silent.

Callers today:

- ``find_commanders`` indexes a bulk-data card pool and looks up
  collection entries against it.
- ``mark_owned`` intersects a parsed deck against a parsed collection
  to populate ``owned_cards``.

Both need ``"Lim-Dul's Vault"`` (ASCII-only collection export) to match
``"Lim-Dûl's Vault"`` (bulk-data canonical) and neither cares about
case. If a future script needs a different normalization (e.g., split
cards), add a new function here rather than diverging in place.

    Some cards are known on Arena by a different name than Scryfall's
    canonical ``name`` field:

    - **``printed_name``** — Through the Omenpaths (OM1) cards have
      Arena-specific names (e.g., "Skittering Kitten") while Scryfall
      uses the paper name ("Masked Meower").
    - **``flavor_name``** — Ikoria Godzilla variants, Crimson Vow
      Dracula variants, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Final Fantasy
      crossovers have IP names that Arena may display.

    Collection exports from Arena / Untapped.gg often use these
    alternate names, causing ``mark_owned`` to miss cards whose
    canonical name differs. This map lets callers fall back to alias
    matching when direct matching fails.

    Only English-language Arena cards are indexed. Non-English
    ``printed_name`` values (e.g., Japanese Mystical Archive) are
    excluded to avoid false matches.
