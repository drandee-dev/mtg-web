"""Import an MTG Arena collection + wildcard counts from Player.log.

MTG Arena writes a ``<== StartHook`` log entry at login that embeds
``InventoryInfo`` (gold, gems, wildcards, vault progress) and ``Decks``
(every saved deck with its card lists). This script pulls the wildcard
counts from ``InventoryInfo`` and assembles an owned-cards list from
one of two sources, then writes:

- ``collection.json`` in the same parsed-deck shape as ``parse-deck``
  output, ready to feed straight into ``mark-owned`` or ``find-commanders``.
- ``wildcards.json`` with the four wildcard counts plus metadata the
  tuner reads during Step 3 intake.

Collection paths
----------------

Two ``--collection-source`` values are supported, each trading
completeness for setup friction:

**``decks`` (default): lower-bound reconstruction from the log.**
There used to be a ``PlayerCards`` field on ``<== StartHook`` that was
a direct arena-id → count map of the player's collection. **WotC
removed that structured API in 2021** (confirmed against
``manasight-parser/src/parsers/collection.rs``; its own docstring
admits the field no longer fires). On a real 2026-era Player.log
there is no arena-id → count map anywhere — the login response has
``InventoryInfo``, ``Decks``, ``DeckSummariesV2``, and a dozen other
top-level keys, but nothing resembling a full collection dump. The
only log-derivable source of owned cards is the ``Decks`` dict, whose
entries each have ``MainDeck``, ``Sideboard``, ``CommandZone``, and
``Companions`` lists of ``{cardId, quantity}``. Summing per-printing
quantities across every zone of every saved deck (capped at Arena's
4-copy playset limit) gives a **subset** of the user's real
collection — cards they own but have never put into a deck are
missed. Usually fine for deckbuilding workflows since binder-only
cards are noise for ``find-commanders``-style queries.

**``untapped-csv``: full snapshot from an Untapped.gg CSV export.**
Reads the CSV produced by the "Export Collection" button on
untapped.gg. Covers every printing Arena knows about, including the
newest Alchemy / Universes Beyond sets where Scryfall's ``arena_id``
field is still null. Requires ``--untapped-csv <path>``. No Arena
process, no sudo, no Rust toolchain.

A previous revision of this module also shelled out to a forked
``mtga-reader`` npm package to read the live collection directly
from the Arena process memory. That path was removed — the
signature-based heap scan proved brittle across Arena updates and
the Untapped CSV source provides a cleaner, permission-free full
snapshot with authoritative arena_id → name mappings. Notes from
the investigation (including how Untapped's own in-memory approach
works and what it would take to replicate) live at
``~/repos/mtga-reader/NOTES.md`` alongside the fork itself.

Arena-id resolution notes:

- Scryfall's bulk data has ``arena_id`` on every Arena printing, but a
  single id can reference multiple Scryfall entries when an Alchemy
  rebalance shares its id with the non-rebalanced paper card
  (``A-Teferi, Time Raveler`` and ``Teferi, Time Raveler``). In Historic
  Brawl, players can legitimately use either form, so this importer
  emits a collection entry for **every** name that shares the id.
  ``legality-audit`` downstream will flag any that are banned in the
  user's format.
- ``--untapped-csv`` can be supplied alongside any collection source
  (not just ``untapped-csv``) to act as a supplementary arena_id →
  name resolver: Scryfall's bulk data still takes precedence, but
  ids Scryfall can't map fall back to Untapped's names. This is the
  cleanest way to handle the newest Alchemy / Universes Beyond sets
  where Scryfall's ``arena_id`` field is still null because the
  upstream ingestion hasn't caught up yet.
- Arena grants unlimited copies of the six "free" basic land types
  (``Island``, ``Mountain``, ``Plains``, ``Forest``, ``Swamp``, ``Wastes``),
  so the importer unconditionally injects them at quantity 99 regardless
  of what the collection source reported. Snow-covered basics are
  collected normally and are not injected — if the user owns them, they
  come through via arena-id resolution.

    Returns ``(cards, unresolved_ids)``. ``cards`` is a list of
    ``{"name": str, "quantity": int}`` dicts, sorted by lowercased name
    for deterministic output. When an Arena id maps to multiple names
    (Alchemy collision), every name gets its own entry with a
    properly aggregated quantity.

    **Per-printing aggregation:** Arena stores physical card ownership
    **per printing**, not per oracle name. A card like *Lightning
    Strike* that has been reprinted in multiple sets (XLN, M19, JMP,
    DMU, DFT, TLA...) has a distinct arena_id for each printing, and
    each printing has its own acquired-copy count. The user's true
    ownership of the oracle card "Lightning Strike" is the SUM of
    copies owned across all printings, capped at 4 (Arena's
    deckbuilding limit — once you own 4 physical copies from any
    combination of printings you can deck a full playset). So we:

    1. Sum quantities across every arena_id that resolves to the
       same oracle name.
    2. Cap the total at ``_ARENA_PLAYSET_CAP`` (4). Acquiring
       beyond 4 total is possible in Arena (pack rewards can push
       you past the cap) but not useful for deckbuilding.

    The previous implementation used ``max(prior, count)`` on the
    theory that multiple arena_ids for the same name represented
    "the same physical copies" — that's wrong. Each printing is
    independent physical storage, and max() systematically
    underreports users' true usable ownership.
