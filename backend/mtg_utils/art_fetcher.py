"""Fetch attributed ASCII art for every MTG subtype.

Pulls all subtype names from Scryfall's catalog endpoints, builds a
candidate pool from multiple ASCII art sources (asciiart.eu and Christopher
Johnson's collection at asciiart.website), picks the best fit per subtype
(target ~20x10, hard cap 30x13), and writes one attributed ``<subtype>.txt``
into the directory ``proxy_print`` reads from at render time.

**Sources.** Each ``Source`` carries its own URL builders, HTML parser, and
attribution-header formatter. Today's sources:

- ``asciiart.eu`` — category-page-driven, with an optional ``/search?q=``
  fallback. Reuse with attribution per its FAQ; artist's in-art signature
  is preserved verbatim.
- ``asciiart.website`` — Christopher Johnson's collection. Categories
  auto-discovered from ``browse.php``. Each cat.php page carries JSON-LD
  metadata (artist + URL per piece) plus inline ``<pre>`` art bodies. Each
  written file links back to the per-art URL so per-piece attribution is
  preserved.

A subtype with no acceptable art in any source is not an error; it falls
through to proxy_print's runtime fallback chain at render time.

Fail-loud: any HTTP error (Scryfall or art source) aborts the run with a
non-zero exit code.

    Search order:
    1. ``asciiart.eu /search?q=<full name>`` — handles most multi-word
       MTG names because the engine matches across full titles.
    2. If step 1 returns no fitting hits AND ``website_csrf`` is
