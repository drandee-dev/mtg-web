"""Populate a deck's ``owned_cards`` field from a parsed collection.

This is a tiny utility that replaces a common inline ``python3 -c`` pattern:
reading a parsed-deck JSON and a parsed-collection JSON, computing the
intersection of card names, and writing the result back to the deck's
``owned_cards`` field.

Having a dedicated script matters because every unique ``python3 -c``
body produces a fresh, un-cacheable Bash permission pattern in Claude
Code's sandbox: three variations of the recipe = three permission
prompts. A stable script path (``mark-owned``) is granted once and
reused for the rest of the session.

    Walks both ``commanders`` and ``cards``. The original name is

    chose rather than the normalized form. Quantity is coerced to int
    defensively (parse-deck already does this, but hand-crafted JSON
    might not) and defaults to 1 on malformed input.

    ``sum_duplicates`` controls how to reconcile multiple entries for
    the same card:

    - ``sum_duplicates=True`` (collection side): add the quantities.
      A Moxfield collection export splits the same card across its
      different printings, so e.g. 51 distinct Island rows represent
      205 physical Islands, and only ``sum`` gives the correct owned
      count. Undercounting basics here would make ``price-check``
      think the deck is short on lands it actually has.

    - ``sum_duplicates=False`` (deck side): take the ``max``. Parse-
      deck can emit a card in both ``commanders`` and ``cards`` if the
      user listed their commander in the mainboard for any reason,
      and those two rows describe the same physical copy — summing
      would double-count. The sibling ``find_commanders._build_owned_index``
