"""Shared helpers for scripts that write a sha-keyed JSON sidecar file.

Every script in the tuner that emits a human-readable text report to stdout
also always writes its full structured JSON to a deterministic path so that
downstream scripts and Step 7 self-grill subagents can `Read` it selectively
instead of receiving pasted content. This module centralizes the path
computation and the atomic-write pattern so all scripts stay consistent
and so adding a new filter argument to a script's cache key is a one-line
change.

``sha_keyed_path`` computes ``$TMPDIR/{prefix}-{sha16}.json`` where ``sha16``
is a SHA-256 of the supplied parts truncated to 16 hex chars. Parts are
treated as follows:

* ``Path`` that exists → hashed as ``path:{mtime_ns}:{size}`` so large files
  (e.g. the ~500MB Scryfall bulk JSON) don't need to be content-hashed on
  every call. An absent path hashes to a sentinel so deleting the file
  busts the cache.
* ``bytes`` / ``bytearray`` → hashed by content.
* Anything else → ``str(part)`` hashed by content. This handles strings,
  numbers, ``None``, booleans, tuples of primitives, etc.

``atomic_write_json`` writes to a temporary file alongside the destination
and renames, so a reader that observes the destination file always sees
fully-formed JSON even if a concurrent writer crashes mid-write.
