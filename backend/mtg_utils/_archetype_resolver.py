"""Resolver for cube.designer_intent.stated_archetypes.

Each entry in ``stated_archetypes`` has one of three shapes:

- ``{"name": NAME}`` — preset reference; ``NAME`` must be in
  :data:`mtg_utils.theme_presets.PRESETS`.
- ``{"name": NAME, "members": [PRESET, ...]}`` — archetype group; ``name``
  is the umbrella label and each ``members`` entry must be a known preset.
- ``{"name": NAME, "regex": PATTERN}`` — legacy / custom matcher; used
  when ``NAME`` is not a preset and the cube author has a hand-rolled
  pattern.

Validation: unknown preset names, unknown group members, malformed regex,
duplicate ``name`` values, and missing ``name`` keys all raise ``ValueError``
listing every violation found.
