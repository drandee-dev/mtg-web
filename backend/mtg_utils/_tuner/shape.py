"""Deterministic Shape inference — aggro / midrange / control / combo.

Nothing in the repo classifies a deck's Shape (``score_card`` only *scores cards
given* a shape). This is the clean inverse of those priors, fed by composition
features the snapshot already computes, and it is transparent (returns the per-shape
scores + evidence) and overridable (deck-forge CONTEXT.md, "Shape"; ADR-0024 scales
the conditional floors by it).
