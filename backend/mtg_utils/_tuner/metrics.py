"""The three diagnostic metrics + the Tier-2 flags + the severity-ranked Top issues.

Efficiency (Shape-aware curve/tempo — NOT per-card power, ADR-0009), Template deviation
(over the shared ``slot_budgets`` bands), and Focus (Engine-card concentration over the
deck's signal-derived avenues). Win-cons and protection are Shape-scaled advisory flags

opaque score. ``top_issues`` ranks the findings by severity and is the single
