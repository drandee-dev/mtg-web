"""Per-card Spine / Engine / Filler classification (the tuner's shared substrate).

The tri-partition (deck-forge CONTEXT.md): every nonland, non-commander card is
**Spine** (mandatory scaffolding — ramp / draw / interaction / wipes), **Engine**
(serves an avenue), or **Filler** (serves no avenue here). Lands and commanders are
their own buckets. No new matchers: Spine roles come from ``budgets.role_of`` and
avenue-serving from ``ranking.score_candidate``/``serves`` — both bottoming out in
``theme_presets`` (ADR-0023).
